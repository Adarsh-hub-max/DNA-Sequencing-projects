DNA Sequencing: Comparative Analysis of Human, Chimpanzee, and Dog Genomes
This project focuses on the comparative analysis of DNA sequencing data from humans, chimpanzees, and dogs. By examining these three species, we aim to highlight genetic similarities and differences that can provide insights into evolutionary relationships and functional genomics.

Features:
Human Genome Data: Utilizes publicly available DNA sequencing data for comprehensive analysis.
Chimpanzee Genome Data: Comparative analysis with human data to explore evolutionary connections.
Dog Genome Data: Offers a look into the genomic differences with a focus on traits such as domestication and behavior.
Bioinformatics Pipelines: Includes tools and scripts for DNA sequence alignment, mutation analysis, and evolutionary modeling.
Visualization: Graphical representations of key results for easier interpretation of genomic data.
Technologies Used:
Python for data processing and analysis
Biopython and other bioinformatics libraries
Jupyter notebooks for documentation and visualization
Applications:
Understanding the genetic basis of evolution
Comparative genomics research
Genomic data analysis techniques
